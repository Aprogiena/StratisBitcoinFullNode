We are still working with the Stratis full node code here (from GitHub repository branch 
https://github.com/Aprogiena/StratisBitcoinFullNode/tree/experiment/hrpuzz). 
The project contains many tests. One of the tests inside Stratis.Bitcoin.Features.MemoryPool.Tests 
project fails. Can you help us fixing it?

Once you fix the test properly, you can calculate an ID of the transaction that this test creates. 
Take the ID and XOR it with
