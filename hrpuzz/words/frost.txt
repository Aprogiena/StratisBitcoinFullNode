To get the next word, exploit CVE-2012-2459 against a block number 333445 on the Stratis test net. 
Once you create such a block, connect to a special node that is running on IP address 52.233.33.138
and present that block using Block2 payload to the node after a normal handshake. 

Block2 payload is exactly the same as Block payload, except for its network command, which is "block2".

If the solution is correct, the special node replies with Phrase payload (network command "phrasere"), which contains:

– instructions message (150 bytes long byte array that encodes next instructions as a string with 0 bytes padding at the end)
