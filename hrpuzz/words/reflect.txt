Next one is easy. Just generate a private key and public key pair, such that the mainnet Stratis 
address representing the public key starts with "STRAT" (case-sensitive).

Then connect to a special node on testnet that listens on this IP address: 52.233.33.138 and after 
a standard handshake send it VanityRequest payload and receive VanityResponse payload.

VanityRequest (network command "vanityreq") is defined as:

– compressed public key P, which address on Stratis mainnet starts with "STRAT" (33 bytes long byte array)
- length L of signature (1 byte)
- signature of SHA256d(P) created with the corresponding private key (L bytes long byte array)

If the solution is correct, the special node replies with VanityResponse (network command "vanityres"), which contains:

– the next word (8 bytes long byte array that encodes the word as a string with 0 bytes padding at the end)
