Welcome to the Stratis puzzle and congratulations for going through the first stage! This already makes you special, 
but you still have a long way to go if you want a prize.

Your objective here is to solve 12 (or maybe more?) puzzles. You already solved the first one. 
Solving a puzzle usually reveals a dictionary word. Together they form 12 word seed that you can use 
to unlock the prize.

If you solve all the puzzles you can claim the prize of at least 4000 STRATs unless, of course, 
someone claims the prize before you do.

The prize is stored in the following Stratis address: `SMnfE1HmgMpRWmtk3ABLsWDC1whoQYB7oB`

You can use the [Stratis Blockchain Explorer](https://chainz.cryptoid.info/strat/address.dws?SMnfE1HmgMpRWmtk3ABLsWDC1whoQYB7oB.htm) to see if someone claimed the prize already.

You don't need a permission or any kind of registration to start solving the puzzles and to claim the prize. 

Additionally, we have 2 open job offers for a couple of participants who solve at least 10 puzzles and apply for the job.
To apply for the job after solving at least 10 puzzles, contact `@aprogiena#0038` on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/9tDyfZs).
We will interview you and ask you to demonstrate that you solved the puzzles yourself, 
or at least that you are fully capable to do so. This means that just knowing 10 words from the seed won't get you the job :-).


For community discussion about the puzzles and to get hints, visit `#puzzle` on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/9tDyfZs).
We would highly appreciate your feedback, even if you don't want to share your progress with the community. 
Please contact `@aprogiena#0038` on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/9tDyfZs), to provide your feedback and share with us 
your progress. Also please contact us in case you find a bug in our puzzles.

Are you ready? Do you think you have what it takes to become a Stratis developer? Or do you just want the money? All good!
You can find the puzzles in the [words folder](https://github.com/Aprogiena/StratisBitcoinFullNode/tree/experiment/hrpuzz/hrpuzz/words). 
To start solving the second puzzle, start with `market`.

If a major bug is found in our puzzles, we will reward the one who reports it to us and we will publish a fix and explanation 
on this page as soon as possible.

Shortly after all prizes are claimed (the money and the 2 job offers), we will publish solutions to all puzzles on this page 
to prove it was genuine. If the prize money is not claimed within 6 months, we will also publish the solutions to the puzzles 
to prove it was genuine, but we will keep the money.
